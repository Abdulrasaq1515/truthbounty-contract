/**
 * @title V2TimeBounds
 * @notice Canonical library implementing time envelopes, block timestamp/number assumptions,
 *         and validation rules for the TruthBounty V2 protocol on Optimism (OP Stack).
 * @dev Governed by PREWAVE-SC-090 (issue #766).
 *
 *      KEY PROTOCOL INVARIANTS:
 *      1. Authoritative Clock: `block.timestamp` is the only clock. All timing gates use
 *         envelopes (>=, <=) to tolerate sub-second execution, same-timestamp blocks, and sequencer drift.
 *      2. Sequencer Drift Bounded: Sequencer timestamp drift is bounded by OP_MAX_SEQUENCER_DRIFT (600s).
 *         Because MIN_DEADLINE_BUFFER is 1 hour (3600s), a 600s drift represents <17% of the buffer
 *         and cannot prematurely invalidate valid actions.
 *      3. Monotonicity: `currentTimestamp >= previousTimestamp` is verified; same-timestamp transactions
 *         within the same block (`dt == 0`) are handled safely without division by zero.
 *      4. Block Number Restrictions: `block.number` advances ~6x faster on OP Stack (2s) than Ethereum L1 (12s).
 *         Using `block.number` as a clock causes massive economic and security skew. Its use is strictly
 *         limited to same-block action barriers and historical checkpoint indexing.
