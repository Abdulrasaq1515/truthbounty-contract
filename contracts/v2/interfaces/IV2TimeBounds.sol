 * @title IV2TimeBounds
 * @notice Canonical V2 interface defining block timestamp and number assumptions,
 *         bounds, and validation errors for the TruthBounty protocol on Optimism (OP Stack).
 * @dev Governed by PREWAVE-SC-090 (issue #766).
 *
 *      AUTHORITATIVE CLOCK SPECIFICATION:
 *      1. `block.timestamp` is the SOLE authoritative time source for all time-based state transitions
 *         (deadlines, decay intervals, timelocks, cooldowns, round lifecycle, and settlement finality).
 *      2. On Optimism (OP Stack), `block.timestamp` advances monotonically per block (target 2.0s).
 *         The sequencer timestamp drift is bounded by `max_sequencer_drift` (canonical 600s).
 *      3. All protocol deadlines require minimum duration envelopes (>= 1 hour) so that sequencer
 *         drift of <= 600s cannot prematurely expire or invalidate honest transactions.
 *      4. `block.number` reflects the L2 execution block index (~2.0s per block, ~43,200 blocks/day),
 *         which advances ~6x faster than Ethereum L1 (~12.0s per block, ~7,200 blocks/day).
 *         `block.number` MUST NEVER be used as a clock or duration measurement in protocol logic.
 *      5. Permissible uses of `block.number` are strictly bounded to:
 *         (a) Same-block mutation and reentrancy barriers (e.g. anti-double-slashing per block).
 *         (b) Historical snapshot and checkpoint indexing (e.g. voting power binary search).
 *         (c) Discrete sequence and ordering assertions within a block.
